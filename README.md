# Gemini API

Gemini API is a simple Express application built with Node.js and TypeScript. This project serves as a basic template for creating RESTful APIs.

## Features

- A test route that responds with "Hello World" or "The API is working".
- Built with TypeScript for type safety and better development experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
